# Religious Values Test
The Third Version (14th of March, 22).



C0ncentus

this test promoted extremism thoughts.
I want to upgrade this to be Ok with 
- wikipedia
- non-bias oriented (more faith-in-practice)
- neutral and not-knowing dissociated
- add political spectrum associated
- 5 choices more meaningfull rather than "1,2,3,4,5"
